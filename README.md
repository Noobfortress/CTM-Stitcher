# CTM-Stitcher
This is a java program which allows for easier testing of connected textures for Minecraft<br>
It allows you to quickly test whether the connected textures you've created work or not, 
by creating a texture representing a 3x3 of blocks

For more info on connected textures, go see https://github.com/Chisel-Team/ConnectedTexturesMod
